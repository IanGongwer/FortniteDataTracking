# FortniteDataTracking
An application that allows the user to view statistics and draw conclusions based on them.

The GUI was created with the tkinter library (https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html).

The data needs to be formatted in the following csv order:
Place, Name, Points, Games Played, Games Won, Average Kills, Average Placement
Note: Average Kills and Average Placement are on a per game basis.

This desktop application was created with Python 3.9.6. Run the GUI by opening the window.py file.
